Almost all packages for machine learning are automatically installed, and I suspect you could the entire project on Colab if you wanted to. Still, it is useful to learn how to set up your environment on your own pc as well, and Colab is a bit more complicated when you have to import your datasets (best to import them from a Google Drive for speed). Colab could become useful if you intend to try the deep learning approaches with TensorFlow and PyTorch, and you don't have a GPU yourself."

    "Encoding cyclical continuous features, such as hour of the day, day of the week, or month of the year, into two dimensions using sine and cosine transformations can be useful for certain machine learning algorithms. This is because these algorithms might not inherently understand the cyclical nature of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we're predicting energy usage based on the time of day, the raw numeric encoding can be misleading: 23 (representing 11pm) and 1 (representing 1am) are numerically far apart, even though they are only 2 hours apart in real world. So if we don't encode these cyclical features, the model may learn incorrect associations, such as predicting a significant drop in energy usage from 11pm (23) to 1am (1), when in reality the change may not be significant."
